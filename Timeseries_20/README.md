To estimate the initial parameters (p, d, q) for an ARIMA model,use statistical tests and the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots.

d (Differencing): The number of times needed to difference the data to make it stationary. Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for this.

q (Moving Average): The order of the MA term, estimated from the ACF plot.

p (AutoRegressive): The order of the AR term, estimated from the PACF plot
